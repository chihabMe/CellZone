## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js / Next.js**: We are using React.js and Next.js to build a dynamic and responsive user interface. Next.js helps in server-side rendering and static site generation for better performance and SEO.

### Backend
- **Next.js / React Server Actions**: Next.js is also utilized for server-side logic, providing a seamless integration between frontend and backend. React Server Actions streamline data fetching and mutations.

### Deployment
- **Vercel**: Our application is deployed on Vercel, which offers great support for Next.js applications, ensuring fast and reliable deployment.

### Database
- **Turso SQLite**: We are using Turso SQLite as our database solution. It is lightweight, fast, and easy to manage, making it ideal for our needs.

### Caching
- **React Query**: React Query is used for caching and synchronizing server state, making data fetching simple and efficient.

### Languages
- **TypeScript**: The entire codebase is written in TypeScript for improved code quality, better documentation, and fewer runtime errors.

### Design
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling. It provides a utility-first approach, which helps in building responsive designs quickly.
- **Framer Motion**: Framer Motion is used for animations and interactive elements, enhancing the user experience.
